There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

|**State**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`open`|This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.|
|`closed`|When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.|
|`filtered`|Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.|
|`unfiltered`|This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.|
|`open\|filtered`|If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.|
|`closed\|filtered`|This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.|
By default, nmap scans top 1000 ports with `-sS`
Ports can be defined one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`)
For all ports scan, `-p-`

## Connect Scan

The Nmap [TCP Connect Scan](https://nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html) (`-sT`) uses the TCP three-way handshake to determine if a specific port on a target host is open or closed. The scan sends an `SYN` packet to the target port and waits for a response. It is considered open if the target port responds with an `SYN-ACK` packet and closed if it responds with an `RST` packet.

## UDP Ports

Since `UDP` is a `stateless protocol` and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole `UDP scan` (`-sU`) much slower than the `TCP scan` (`-sS`).

`For version scan, we use -sV`

## Outputting formats

- Normal output (`-oN`) with the `.nmap` file extension
- Grepable output (`-oG`) with the `.gnmap` file extension
- XML output (`-oX`) with the `.xml` file extension
- All formats (`-oA`) 

# Nmap Scripting Engine

There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

|**Category**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`auth`|Determination of authentication credentials.|
|`broadcast`|Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.|
|`brute`|Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.|
|`default`|Default scripts executed by using the `-sC` option.|
|`discovery`|Evaluation of accessible services.|
|`dos`|These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.|
|`exploit`|This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.|
|`external`|Scripts that use external services for further processing.|
|`fuzzer`|This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.|
|`intrusive`|Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.|
|`malware`|Checks if some malware infects the target system.|
|`safe`|Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.|
|`version`|Extension for service detection.|
|`vuln`|Identification of specific vulnerabilities.|

# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. The `dropped` packets are ignored, and no response is returned from the host.

This is different for rejected packets, which elicit an explicit response. TCP packets are returned with an RST flag, while ICMP can contain different types of error codes.

Such errors include:

- Net Unreachable
- Net Prohibited
- Host Unreachable
- Host Prohibited
- Port Unreachable
- Proto Unreachable

Nmap's TCP ACK scan (`-sA`) method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (`-sS`) or Connect scans (`sT`) because they only send a TCP packet with only the `ACK` flag. When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an `RST` flag. Unlike outgoing connections, all connection attempts (with the `SYN` flag) from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls. However, the packets with the `ACK` flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network.

## Detecting IDS/IPS

Unlike firewalls and their rules, the detection of IDS/IPS systems is much more difficult because these are passive traffic monitoring systems. `IDS systems` examine all connections between hosts.

`IPS systems` take measures configured by the administrator independently to prevent potential attacks automatically. It is essential to know that IDS and IPS are different applications and that IPS serves as a complement to IDS.

- `IDS systems` alone are usually there to help administrators detect potential attacks on their network. They can then decide how to handle such connections. We can trigger certain security measures from an administrator, for example, by aggressively scanning a single port and its service. Based on whether specific security measures are taken, we can detect if the network has some monitoring applications or not.
- One method to determine whether such `IPS system` is present in the target network is to scan from a single host (`VPS`). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, we know that the administrator has taken some security measures. Accordingly, we can continue our penetration test with another `VPS`.

## Decoys

There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method (`-D`) is the right choice. With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (`RND`) a specific number (for example: `5`) of IP addresses separated by a colon (`:`). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses.

```
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5
```

## DNS Proxying

By default, `Nmap` performs a reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified to find more important information about our target. These DNS queries are also passed in most cases because the given web server is supposed to be found and visited. The DNS queries are made over the `UDP port 53`. The `TCP port 53` was previously only used for the so-called "`Zone transfers`" between the DNS servers or data transfer larger than 512 bytes. More and more, this is changing due to IPv6 and DNSSEC expansions. These changes cause many DNS requests to be made via TCP port 53.

`Nmap` still gives us a way to specify DNS servers ourselves (`--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`). The company's DNS servers are usually more trusted than those from the Internet. So, for example, we could use them to interact with the hosts of the internal network. As another example, we can use `TCP port 53` as a source port (`--source-port`) for our scans. If the administrator uses the firewall to control this port and does not filter IDS/IPS properly, our TCP packets will be trusted and passed through. 

```
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace --source-port 53
```
