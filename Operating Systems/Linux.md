| `Bootloader`      | A piece of code that runs to guide the booting process to start the operating system. Parrot Linux uses the GRUB Bootloader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `OS Kernel`       | The kernel is the main component of an operating system. It manages the resources for system's I/O devices at the hardware level.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Daemons`         | Background services are called "daemons" in Linux. Their purpose is to ensure that key functions such as scheduling, printing, and multimedia are working correctly. These small programs load after we booted or log into the computer.                                                                                                        |
| `OS Shell`        | The operating system shell or the command language interpreter (also known as the command line) is the interface between the OS and the user. This interface allows the user to tell the OS what to do. The most commonly used shells are Bash, Tcsh/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, and Fish.                                                                   |
| `Graphics server` | This provides a graphical sub-system (server) called "X" or "X-server" that allows graphical programs to run locally or remotely on the X-windowing system.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Window Manager`  | Also known as a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many options, including GNOME, KDE, MATE, Unity, and Cinnamon. A desktop environment usually has several applications, including file and web browsers. These allow the user to access and manage the essential and frequently accessed features and services of an operating system. |
| `Utilities`       | Applications or utilities are programs that perform particular functions for the user or another program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

# Find Files and Directories

```
find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

| **Option**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-type f`             | Hereby, we define the type of the searched object. In this case, '`f`' stands for '`file`'.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-name *.conf`        | With '`-name`', we indicate the name of the file we are looking for. The asterisk (`*`) stands for 'all' files with the '`.conf`' extension.                                                                                                                                   |
| `-user root`          | This option filters all files whose owner is the root user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-size +20k`          | We can then filter all the located files and specify that we only want to see the files that are larger than 20 KiB.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-newermt 2020-03-03` | With this option, we set the date. Only files newer than the specified date will be presented.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `-exec ls -al {} \;`  | This option executes the specified command, using the curly brackets as placeholders for each result. The backslash escapes the next character from being interpreted by the shell because otherwise, the semicolon would terminate the command and not reach the redirection. |
| `2>/dev/null`         | This is a `STDERR` redirection to the '`null device`'. This redirection ensures that no errors are displayed in the terminal. This redirection must `not` be an option of the 'find' command.                                                                                  |

# File Descriptors and Redirections

A **file descriptor** (`FD`) in Unix/Linux operating systems is a reference, maintained by the kernel, that allows the system to manage Input/Output (`I/O`) operations. It acts as a unique identifier for an open file, socket, or any other I/O resource. In Windows-based operating systems, this is known as a `file handle`. Essentially, the file descriptor is the system's way of keeping track of active `I/O` connections, such as reading from or writing to a file.

By default, the first three file descriptors in Linux are:

1. Data Stream for Input
    - `STDIN – 0`
2. Data Stream for Output
    - `STDOUT – 1`
3. Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring.
    - `STDERR – 2`

## Pipes

Another way to redirect `STDOUT` is to use pipes (`|`). These are useful when we want to use the `STDOUT` from one program to be processed by another.

```shell-session
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd
```

# Permission Management

The whole permission system on Linux systems is based on the octal number system, and basically, there are three different types of permissions a file or directory can be assigned:

- (`r`) - Read
- (`w`) - Write
- (`x`) - Execute

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /etc/passwd

- rwx rw- r--   1 root root 1641 May  4 23:42 /etc/passwd
- --- --- ---   |  |    |    |   |__________|
|  |   |   |    |  |    |    |        |_ Date
|  |   |   |    |  |    |    |__________ File Size
|  |   |   |    |  |    |_______________ Group
|  |   |   |    |  |____________________ User
|  |   |   |    |_______________________ Number of hard links
|  |   |   |_ Permission of others (read)
|  |   |_____ Permissions of the group (read, write)
|  |_________ Permissions of the owner (read, write, execute)
|____________ File type (- = File, d = Directory, l = Link, ... )
```

## Change permission

We can modify permissions using the `chmod` command, permission group references (`u` - owner, `g` - Group, `o` - others, `a` - All users), and either a [`+`] or a [`-`] to add or remove the designated permissions.

```shell-session
Binary Notation:                4 2 1  |  4 2 1  |  4 2 1
----------------------------------------------------------
Binary Representation:          1 1 1  |  1 0 1  |  1 0 0
----------------------------------------------------------
Octal Value:                      7    |    5    |    4
----------------------------------------------------------
Permission Representation:      r w x  |  r - x  |  r - -
```


## Change Owner

```shell-session
chown <user>:<group> <file/directory>
```

## SUID & SGID

In addition to standard user and group permissions, Linux allows us to configure special permissions on files through the Set User ID (`SUID`) and Set Group ID (`SGID`) bits. These bits function like temporary access passes, enabling users to run certain programs with the privileges of another user or group. For example, administrators can use `SUID` or `SGID` to grant users elevated rights for specific applications, allowing tasks to be performed with the necessary permissions, even if the user themselves doesn’t normally have them.

# User Management

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`sudo`|Execute command as a different user.|
|`su`|The `su` utility requests appropriate user credentials via PAM and switches to that user ID (the default user is the superuser). A shell is then executed.|
|`useradd`|Creates a new user or update default new user information.|
|`userdel`|Deletes a user account and related files.|
|`usermod`|Modifies a user account.|
|`addgroup`|Adds a group to the system.|
|`delgroup`|Removes a group from the system.|
|`passwd`|Changes user password.|

# Package Management

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dpkg`|The `dpkg` is a tool to install, build, remove, and manage Debian packages. The primary and more user-friendly front-end for `dpkg` is aptitude.|
|`apt`|Apt provides a high-level command-line interface for the package management system.|
|`aptitude`|Aptitude is an alternative to apt and is a high-level interface to the package manager.|
|`snap`|Install, configure, refresh, and remove snap packages. Snaps enable the secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities for the cloud, servers, desktops, and the internet of things.|
|`gem`|Gem is the front-end to RubyGems, the standard package manager for Ruby.|
|`pip`|Pip is a Python package installer recommended for installing Python packages that are not available in the Debian archive. It can work with version control repositories (currently only Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before starting installation.|
|`git`|Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.|

# Service and Process Management

Daemons are often identified by the letter `d` at the end of their program names, such as `sshd` (SSH daemon) or `systemd`.

Most modern Linux distributions have adopted `systemd` as their initialization system (init system). It is the first process that starts during the boot process and is assigned the Process ID (`PID`). All processes in a Linux system are assigned a `PID` and can be viewed under the `/proc/` directory, which contains information about each process. Processes may also have a Parent Process ID (`PPID`), indicating that they were started by another process (the parent), making them child processes.

# File System Management

- `ext2` is an older file system with no journaling capabilities, which makes it less suited for modern systems but still useful in certain low-overhead scenarios (like USB drives).
    
- `ext3` and `ext4` are more advanced, with journaling (which helps in recovering from crashes), and ext4 is the default choice for most modern Linux systems because it offers a balance of performance, reliability, and large file support.
    
- `Btrfs` is known for advanced features like snapshotting and built-in data integrity checks, making it ideal for complex storage setups.
    
- `XFS` excels at handling large files and has high performance. It is best suited for environments with high I/O demands
    
- `NTFS`, originally developed for Windows, is useful for compatibility when dealing with dual-boot systems or external drives that need to work on both Linux and Windows systems.

Linux's file system architecture is based on the Unix model, organized in a hierarchical structure. This structure consists of several components, the most critical being `inodes`. `Inodes` are data structures that store metadata about each file and directory, including permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps. Inodes do not store the file’s actual data or name, but they contain pointers to the blocks where the file’s data is stored on the disk.

# Network Configuration

## Network Access Control

|**Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Discretionary Access Control (`DAC`)|This model allows the owner of the resource to set permissions for who can access it.|
|Mandatory Access Control (`MAC`)|Permissions are enforced by the operating system, not the owner of the resource, making it more secure but less flexible.|
|Role-Based Access Control (`RBAC`)|Permissions are assigned based on roles within an organization, making it easier to manage user privileges.|
## Hardening

### Security-Enhanced Linux
Security-Enhanced Linux (`SELinux`) is a mandatory access control (`MAC`) system integrated into the Linux kernel. It provides fine-grained control over access to system resources and applications by enforcing security policies. These policies define the permissions for each process and file on the system, significantly limiting the damage that a compromised process or service can do. SELinux operates at a low level, and though it offers strong security, it can be complex to configure and manage due to its granular controls.
### AppArmor
Like SELinux, `AppArmor` is a MAC system that controls access to system resources and applications, but it operates in a simpler, more user-friendly manner. AppArmor is implemented as a Linux Security Module (`LSM`) and uses application profiles to define what resources an application can access. While it may not provide the same level of fine-grained control as SELinux, AppArmor is often easier to configure and is generally considered more straightforward for day-to-day use.

### TCP Wrappers
`TCP wrappers` are a host-based network access control tool that restricts access to network services based on the IP address of incoming connections. When a network request is made, TCP wrappers intercept it, checking the request against a list of allowed or denied IP addresses. This is a simple yet effective way to control access to services, especially for blocking unauthorized systems from accessing networked resources. While it does not offer the fine-grained control of SELinux or AppArmor, TCP wrappers are an excellent tool for basic network-level protection.
